# SafeAR - Support Privacy and Confidentiality in Augmented Reality Contexts

SafeAR is an exploratory research project funded by FCT (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia). It addresses privacy issues in Augmented Reality (AR) environments while maintaining the usefulness and functioning of AR applications by utilizing obfuscation techniques as blurring, pixelation, and masking.

The SafeAR Questionnaire was designed to disseminate, collect, and analyze data on the effectiveness and user preferences for these obfuscation techniques, contributing to the development of privacy-preserving solutions in AR.

## Repository

This repository contains the notebook with the source code used to analyze responses from the SafeAR Questionnaire. The analysis directly contributed to the writing of a scientific article (coming soon...). The data collected can be made available upon requested.
